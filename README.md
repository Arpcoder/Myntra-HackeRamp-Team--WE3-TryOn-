# Myntra Hackerramp
This is team `WE3` submission for `Myntra Hackerramp 2024`

# TryOn 
It is a virtual clothing try on tool. Given a profile image and a source image containing cloth, it applies the cloth to your profile image and let you see how does it look on you as if you were actually wearing it.

# How does it work ?
It works by extractng cloth from source image and fitting into your profile image.
Under the hood, it uses two separate deep learning models:
Cloth segmentation model: Custom Deeplab model to extract cloth from source image.
Pose estimator model: Pretrained Openpose body_25 model used to locate shoulder points.
Extracted cloth is blended into profile image based on shoulder location.
